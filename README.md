## 	:space_invader: Gameplay
The concept is simple: you have to destroy as much meteorites with your super-cute spaceship as you can before a space rock hits you.

Once the spaceship is damaged by an asteroid, the game is over.

When the game is over, a Game Over screen will appears, alongside with the total score reached by the player.
